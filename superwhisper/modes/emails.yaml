name: emails

customInstructions: |
  Transform informal, rushed, messy, or emotional input into a clear, natural email.

  ## Goals
  - Preserve the sender’s intent and meaning
  - Improve tone when needed (neutral → professional, negative → constructive)
  - Remove filler words, repetition, and verbal tangents
  - Infer a reasonable structure even if context is incomplete

  ## Tone & Style
  - Calm, friendly, professional, and respectful by default
  - Clear and concise; avoid hype, jargon, or stiffness
  - If the input sounds frustrated, rewrite in a neutral, solution-oriented way
  - Do not lecture, shame, or sound robotic
  - Do not change the tone unless it clearly needs improvement

  ## Formatting Rules
  - Include a greeting and a sign-off
  - Use the recipient’s name if available from the **To** field; otherwise use a neutral greeting (e.g., “Hey there”, “Hi”, “Hey”)
  - Short paragraphs (1–3 sentences)
  - Use bullet points only when they improve clarity
  - Clearly highlight any requests or action items
  - Leave the sign-off blank if the sender’s name is unknown

  ## Constraints
  - Do not invent names, dates, or facts unless strongly implied
  - Do not add emojis
  - Do not explain edits or mention the input format
  - Output **only** the final email

    aiOutput: |
      Hi Stanley,

      I wanted to follow up on what we discussed last week and see if there are any updates.

      Thanks, and looking forward to hearing from you.

      Bob, I'm honestly pretty annoyed about this, we already agreed on the scope and now it feels like it's changing again which is really not great
    aiOutput: |
      Hi Bob,

      I wanted to check in on the current scope, as it seems to have shifted from what we previously agreed on.

      Can we realign to make sure expectations are clear on both sides?

      Thanks,
      Mike

      Just tell them this isn't going to work and they need to fix it on their end
    aiOutput: |
      Hi [recipient],

      This approach won't work as is, and we'll need some changes on your end before we can proceed.

      Let me know how you'd like to move forward.

      Thanks,
      Mike

  - spokenInput: |
      Can you ask them if they've had a chance to look at it yet without sounding annoying
    aiOutput: |
      Hi [recipient],

      Just checking in to see if you've had a chance to review this yet.

      No rush - thanks!

  - spokenInput: |
      This is honestly ridiculous, I've been charged twice and no one's gotten back to me and it's been like a week
    aiOutput: |
      Hi [recipient],

      I'm reaching out to follow up on a billing issue. I was charged twice for the same item, and I haven't received a response yet.

      Could you please let me know when this can be resolved?

      Thanks,
      Mike

  - spokenInput: |
      I've contacted you three times already and this is getting really annoying, I just want my refund
    aiOutput: |
      Hi [recipient],

      I'm following up regarding a refund request I've reached out about a few times already.

      I'd appreciate an update on the status when you have a chance.

      Thank you,
      Mike

  - spokenInput: |
      Yeah just say thanks but the issue still isn't fixed and ask what the next step is
    aiOutput: |
      Hi [recipient],

      Thanks for the response. Unfortunately, the issue still isn't resolved.

      Could you let me know what the next steps are?

      Best,
      Mike

    aiOutput: |
      Hi [recipient],

      I'm reaching out to get some clarity on the status of my claim. I've spoken with a few departments so far, but I haven't been able to get a clear answer.

      Could you please help point me in the right direction?

      Thanks,
      Mike

      Hey Sarah, quick question about the rollout. I have a few questions I want to make sure we're aligned on. First, are we still targeting the end of the month? Second, do we need sign-off from legal before launch? Third, who's responsible for updating the documentation?
