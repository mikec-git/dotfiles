# Smart Commit

An intelligent Git workflow that analyzes your changes, groups them logically, commits them in the right order, and pushes - all automatically.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze Changes

1. Run `git status` to identify all modified, added, deleted, and **untracked** files
2. Run `git diff` (unstaged) and `git diff --staged` (staged) to understand what changed
3. For untracked files/directories, read their contents to understand what they add
4. For each file (modified or untracked), determine the change type:
   - **Feature**: New functionality, new files, new capabilities
   - **Bugfix**: Fixing broken behavior, error corrections
   - **Chore**: Dependencies, configs, build scripts, formatting
   - **Docs**: README, comments, documentation files
   - **Refactor**: Code restructuring without behavior change

**Auto-exclude from commits:**

- `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, and other OS-generated files
- `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, `.venv/`, and other dependency directories
- Files matching patterns in `.gitignore`

### Step 2: Smart File Grouping

Group related files that should be committed together (including untracked files):

- Component file + its test file + its styles
- API route + its handler + its types
- Config file + files that depend on that config
- Migration + model changes
- Install scripts with their associated config files

Separate unrelated changes into distinct groups. Each group = one commit.

**For new directories:** Analyze the contents and apply the same grouping logic as modified files. Don't assume a new directory is a single commit - split it up if files serve different purposes.

### Step 3: Determine Commit Order

Order the commit groups logically:

1. Infrastructure/config changes (package.json, tsconfig, etc.)
2. Database/schema changes
3. Core logic and business rules
4. UI components and features
5. Tests
6. Documentation

Dependencies should be committed before dependents.

### Step 4: Execute Commits

For each commit group:

1. Stage the files: `git add <files>`
2. Create commit with flagged message format:
   ```
   [Feature] Add user authentication flow
   [Bugfix] Fix null check in payment handler
   [Chore] Update dependencies
   [Docs] Update README with API examples
   ```
3. Include the standard footer:

   ```

### Step 5: Intelligent Conflict Resolution

Before pushing:

1. Run `git fetch origin`
2. Check if branch is behind remote: `git status -uno`

If the branch is behind, automatically resolve conflicts:

1. Run `git pull --no-edit` to attempt auto-merge
2. If conflicts occur, for each conflicting file:
   - Read both versions (HEAD and incoming)
   - Understand the intent of each change
   - Merge intelligently by:
     - Keeping all new functionality from both sides
     - Preserving bug fixes from both versions
     - Combining import statements without duplicates
     - Ensuring no code is accidentally deleted
     - Resolving whitespace/formatting to match project style
   - Verify the merged result makes logical sense
   - Check that the merge doesn't introduce bugs (type errors, undefined references, broken logic)
3. Stage resolved files: `git add <resolved-files>`
4. Complete the merge: `git commit --no-edit`
5. If unable to resolve safely, report the specific conflict and stop

### Step 6: Push & Report

1. Push to remote: `git push`
2. Display summary report:

   ```
   Smart Commit Summary
   ====================
   Commits: 3

   1. [Feature] Add login component (4 files)
   2. [Feature] Add auth API routes (3 files)
   3. [Chore] Update dependencies (1 file)

   Conflicts resolved: 2 files (auth.ts, config.json)
   Pushed to: origin/main
   ```

## Dry-Run Mode

When the user says "dry run", "preview", or adds "--dry-run":

1. Perform all analysis steps (1-3)
2. Display proposed commit groupings
3. Show planned commit messages
4. **DO NOT execute any git commands**
5. End with: "This was a dry run. Say '/commit' to execute."

## Commit Flag Reference

| Flag         | Use When                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `[Feature]`  | Adding new functionality or capabilities   |
| `[Bugfix]`   | Fixing broken behavior or errors           |
| `[Chore]`    | Dependencies, configs, tooling, formatting |
| `[Docs]`     | Documentation, README, code comments       |
| `[Refactor]` | Restructuring without behavior change      |
| `[Test]`     | Adding or updating tests only              |

## Edge Cases

- **No changes**: Report "No changes to commit" and exit
- **Only staged changes**: Commit staged changes, ignore unstaged
- **Only unstaged changes**: Stage all relevant files automatically
- **Mixed staged/unstaged**: Include both in the analysis and grouping
- **Untracked files**: Automatically include relevant files, exclude OS files and dependencies
- **Unresolvable conflict**: If a conflict is too complex to resolve safely, stop and report the specific issue
